# TypeScript & Type Helpers

In apps, import the helpers below from [`@buildkitgg/typescript-utils`](https://github.com/betterapps-hq/buildkit/tree/main/packages/core/typescript-utils). Use type-only imports for utility types.

```ts
import { chunk, isPresent, match, P, type SetRequired } from "@buildkitgg/typescript-utils"
```

## Conventions

- **No `any`.** If a value is genuinely unknown, type it `unknown` and narrow it.
- **Avoid `as` type assertions.** They silence the compiler. To narrow, prefer, in order: a **type guard**
  (`value is T`) → **`invariant(...)`** (runtime-checked) → **`assertNever`** / **`match(...).exhaustive()`** for
  unions. (`as const` is fine — the ban is on _type assertions_.)
- **Prefer `type` over `interface`.** Reach for `interface` only when you need a feature it uniquely provides (e.g.
  declaration merging).
- **Let return types infer.** Add an explicit return type only to lock a public/shared API contract.
- **Prefer string-literal unions over `enum`s**; pair them with exhaustive handling.
- **Prefix boolean variables** with `is`/`has` (`isLoading`, `hasError`).
- **Validate external data with `zod`** at the boundary (never trust network/env input).

## Type narrowing — order of preference

1. **Type guard** — a `function isThing(x: unknown): x is Thing` predicate.
2. **`invariant(cond, msg)`** — asserts a runtime assumption and narrows afterward.
3. **`assertNever(x)`** / **`match(x).exhaustive()`** — for exhaustive unions.

Do **not** reach for `as`.

### Pattern matching

| Helper | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `isMatching` | Check a value against a pattern or create a reusable type guard. |
| `match` | Branch on a value by matching patterns. |
| `NonExhaustiveError` | Error thrown when an exhaustive match finds no matching branch. |
| `P` | Build patterns and select values within a match. |

Use for branching on unions/shapes instead of `switch` or nested conditionals.

```ts
import { match, P } from "@buildkitgg/typescript-utils"

const label = match(result)
  .with({ status: "ok", data: P.select() }, (data) => `ok: ${data}`)
  .with({ status: "error", error: P.instanceOf(Error) }, ({ error }) => error.message)
  .with({ status: "loading" }, () => "loading…")
  .exhaustive() // compile error if a case is missing
```

Key API:

- `match(value)` → `.with(pattern, handler)` → terminate with `.exhaustive()` (enforces all cases) or `.otherwise(fn)`
  (default). Use `.returnType<T>()` to pin the return type.
- **Patterns (`P`):** `P._` / `P.any`, `P.string`, `P.number`, `P.boolean`, `P.bigint`, `P.nullish`, `P.array(pattern)`,
  `P.set`, `P.map`, `P.union(...)`, `P.intersection(...)`, `P.not(pattern)`, `P.optional(pattern)`,
  `P.instanceOf(Class)`, `P.when(predicate)`, `P.select()` (extract a value), and string/number refinements like
  `P.string.startsWith(...)`, `P.number.gte(...)`.
- `isMatching(pattern)` — a standalone type guard built from a pattern.

String refinements include `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `includes`, `regex`, `length`, `minLength`, and `maxLength`. Numeric patterns offer `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `between`, `positive`, and `negative`. Number patterns also support `int` and `finite`.

Additional matching APIs include `P.unknown`, `P.symbol`, `P.nonNullable`, `P.record`, and `P.shape`. Combine patterns with `.and()` or `.or()`. Use `P.Pattern<T>` to constrain a pattern, `P.infer<typeof pattern>` for the matched type, or `P.narrow<Input, typeof pattern>` to narrow an existing union. Custom matchers use `P.matcher` and the experimental `P.unstable_Fn`, `P.unstable_Matcher`, and `P.unstable_Matchable` types. A match can branch with `.when()` or evaluate with `.run()`. An unmatched exhaustive evaluation throws `NonExhaustiveError`.

### Assertions

| Helper | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `invariant` | Throw if a required condition is falsy and narrow the value afterward. |

```ts
import { invariant } from "@buildkitgg/typescript-utils"

invariant(user, "user must be loaded before render")
user.name // narrowed to non-null here
```

Use an invariant for a condition the program requires to continue. Use schema validation for untrusted input.

## Application-wide declarations

Add `@buildkitgg/typescript-utils/reset` to the app’s `compilerOptions.types` alongside its existing entries. Importing the root package also applies the reset globally. Keep the bundle out of published libraries so their consumers retain control of their global types.

## `zod` — schema validation

Validate and parse untrusted input; infer static types from schemas.

```ts
import { z } from "zod"

const User = z.object({ id: z.string(), email: z.email() })
type User = z.infer<typeof User>

const user = User.parse(await res.json()) // throws on mismatch
const result = User.safeParse(input) // { success, data | error }
```

Pass a Zod schema directly to TanStack Form, for example `validators: { onSubmit: User }`. Reuse the schema at the API
boundary when both inputs have the same contract.
